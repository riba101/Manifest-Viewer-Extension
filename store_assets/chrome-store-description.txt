Manifest Viewer lets you inspect and debug MPEG-DASH (.mpd) and HLS (.m3u8) manifests directly in the browser. See syntax-highlighted playlists, follow clickable URIs with automatic relative resolution, and set custom request headers when needed. Copy manifests as text, auto-open on .m3u8/.mpd visits, switch to a dark developer UI, and dive into MP4 atom structure. Includes a browser media compatibility checker and page scanner to find manifests in use.
